<p> I was introduced to gym by my friend who was into body building. At first, I was totally against it because it would make me too heavy for soccer but I still went ahead and tried doing 50 push-ups a day. That's when I started seeing some positive changes in my torso and that was when I got hooked for good. Now is feels like home simply because even though it brings with it a lot of pain , it also has helped with my confidence, discipline and mental health so I find comfort in being there, working out.</p>

<p> <h3>My top 3 exercises are:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Incline bench press</li>
  <li>Bicep curls</li>
  <li>Leg extensions</li>
</ol>
